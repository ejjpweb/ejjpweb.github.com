### [Fast microwave-assisted synthesis of tailored mesoporous carbon xerogels](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcis.2011.02.034)

Resorcinol-formaldehyde carbon xerogels with several initial pH were synthesized using two different heating methods (conventional and microwave heating). The effect of the pH of the precursor solution and the method of synthesis employed on the textural and chemical properties of the final materials was evaluated. The figure shows a representation of the gelation point of several RF xerogels obtained by microwave heating from precursor solutions with different pHs.
