### [Effect of Mesostructured Layer upon Crystalline Properties and Device Performance on Perovskite Solar Cells](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00483)

One of the most fascinating characteristics of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is the retrieved obtainment of outstanding photovoltaic (PV) performances withstanding important device configuration variations.Here we have analyzed hybrid perovskite material in planar or in mesostructured (MS) configurations, employing both titania and alumina scaffolds, fully infiltrated with perovskite material or presenting an overstanding layer.
