The OSS Lab at the University of Zaragoza provides an open ecosystem for evaluating the operational stability of perovskite solar cells and other emerging photovoltaic technologies. Our mission is to accelerate the development of stable perovskite solar cells by providing open access tools and platforms for long-term stability testing.

## The OSS Ecosystem Components

### Perovskino: Maximum Power Point Tracker
At the heart of our ecosystem is the Perovskino, an open-source and low-cost maximum power point tracking (MPPT) device specifically designed for perovskite solar cells. The complete building instructions and basic operation protocol are detailed in our recent publication:

- [*Protocol for building and using a maximum power point output tracker for perovskite solar cells*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xpro.2024.103394)

Additionally, we have developed and validated an innovative galvanostatic approach to MPPT that has proven particularly effective for devices exhibiting high hysteresis, as described in:

- [*Enhanced power-point tracking for high-hysteresis perovskite solar cells with a galvanostatic approach*](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xcrp.2024.101885)

The complete source code and documentation for the Perovskino are available on GitHub: [github.com/ej-jp/perovskino](https://github.com/ej-jp/perovskino)

### ParaSol: Long-term Stability Testing Platform
ParaSol is our outdoor testing facility located at the University of Zaragoza's Rio Ebro Campus. This platform allows simultaneous testing of multiple devices under real environmental conditions while tracking their maximum power point performance. The platform provides comprehensive data collection including:
- Device performance metrics
- Ambient and device temperature 
- Solar irradiance 
- Relative humidity

We invite researchers worldwide to test their perovskite solar cells on our ParaSol platform. If you're interested in having your devices evaluated, please contact us to discuss testing arrangements.

### Real-time Monitoring
We believe in transparency and open data sharing. You can follow the real-time performance of devices currently under test through our public Telegram channel: [https://t.me/oss_lab](https://t.me/oss_lab)
