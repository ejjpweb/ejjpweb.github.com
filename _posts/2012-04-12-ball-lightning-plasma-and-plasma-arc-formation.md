|*Plasma ball and arc formation during the microwave heating of carbons*|

### [Ball lightning plasma and plasma arc formation during the microwave heating of carbons](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2010.09.010)

Photographic evidence of plasma formation when different carbon materials are subjected to microwave heating is presented. Two different kinds of plasmas are observed: ball lightning and arc discharge plasmas. The intensity of the plasmas in the less ordered carbon was significantly higher at the beginning of the process.
