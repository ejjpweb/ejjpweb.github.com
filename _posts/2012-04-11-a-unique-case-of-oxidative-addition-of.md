### [A Unique Case of Oxidative Addition of Interhalogens IX (X=Cl, Br) to Organodiselone Ligands: Nature of the Chemical Bonding in Asymmetric I-Se-X Polarised Hypervalent Systems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/chem.201100970)

Unprecedented "T-shaped" adducts featuring I-Se-X moieties (X = Cl, Br) have been obtained from the oxidative addition of interhalogens IX to organoselone donors, Atom in Molecules (AIM) and Electron Localization Function (ELF) topological approaches have been used to ascertain the hypervalent nature of the chalcogen atom in these unusual three-body systems. New criteria of analysing hypervalency in these and related systems are proposed.
