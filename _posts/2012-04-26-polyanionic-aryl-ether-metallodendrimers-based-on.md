### [Polyanionic Aryl Ether Metallodendrimers Based on Cobaltabisdicarbollide Derivatives. Photoluminescent Properties](http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/ma9019575)

Fluorescent Fréchet-type poly(aryl ether) dendrimers incorporating the 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene as core molecule and 3, 6, 9, or 12 terminal allyl ether groups have been prepared in very good yield by following the Fréchet convergent approach. Regiospecific hydrosylilation reactions on the allyl ether functions with the cobaltabisdicarbollide derivative Cs[1,1′-μ-SiMeH-3,3′-Co(1,2-C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>9</sub>H<sub>10</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] lead to different generations of Fréchet-type polyanionic metallodendrimers decorated with 3, 6, and 9 cobaltabisdicarbollide units.
