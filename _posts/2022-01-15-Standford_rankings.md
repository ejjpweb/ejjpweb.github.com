Currently, there are three updates to the Stanford ranking:

* Version 1 dataset (Jul 06, 2019) at [https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.1](https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.1)
* Version 2 dataset (Oct 08, 2020) at [https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.2](https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.2)
* Version 3 dataset (Oct 19, 2021) at [https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.3](https://doi.org/10.17632/btchxktzyw.3)

There are two types of classification. The most relevant is the list of scientists in the top 2% of the world which provides *standardized information on citations, h-index, co-authorship adjusted hm-index, citations to papers in different authorship positions and a composite indicator* for their **entire career** and another ranking of scientists in the top 2% of the world but only considering the **latest one year** time frame.

I noticed that I appear in all three versions of the ranking considering single years (but no in the list of career-long impact).

* Ranking Stanford TOP 2% Scientists for the single year 2017: position 100578 out of 106369.
* Ranking Stanford TOP 2% Scientists for the single year 2019: position 75928 out of 161442
* Ranking Stanford TOP 2% Scientists for the single year 2020: position 77644 out of 190064
