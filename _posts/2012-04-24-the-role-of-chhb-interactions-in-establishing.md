### [The Role of C-H···H-B Interactions in Establishing Rotamer Configurations in Metallabis(dicarbollide) Systems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejic.201000157)

The rotamer controversy between the solid state _cisoid_ and the gas phase calculated _transoid_ in [3,3′-Co-(1,2-C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>9</sub>H<sub>11</sub>)<sub>2</sub>]<sup>–</sup> has led to conclude that the anionic environment is crucial to determine the rotamer conformation and crystal packing in metallacarboranes. QTAIM has been applied to study intermolecular H **···** H short contacts that define the preferred rotamer. Its relation to the electron configuration of the transition metal is also studied.
