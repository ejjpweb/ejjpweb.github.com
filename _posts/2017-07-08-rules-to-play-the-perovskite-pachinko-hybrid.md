### Article: [Progress on Novel Perovskite Materials and Solar Cells with Mixed Cations and Halide Anions](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b06001)

Hybrid halide perovskite materials have been studied intensively for photovoltaic applications. Major concerns for the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaic technology to take off include long-term stability and optimal band-gap. Molecular composition engineering has been proposed to address the above concerns. Among the best six certified power conversion efficiencies reported by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) on perovskite-based solar cells, four are based on mixed perovskites. In this article, we review the recent progress on the synthesis and fundamental aspects of mixed cation and halide perovskites correlating with device performance and long-term stability.
