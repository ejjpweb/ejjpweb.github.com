### [Polymer/Perovskite Amplifying Waveguides for Active Hybrid Silicon Photonics](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adma.201503245/abstract)


The emission properties of hybrid halide perovskites are exploited to implement a stable and very low power operation waveguide optical amplifier integrated in a silicon platform.

This novel photonic device is assembled depositing a layer of hybrid halide perovskite and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) on SiO<sub>2</sub>/Si wafer substrate. The PMMA polymer layer simultaneously develops two fundamental roles in the device, first allowing to propagate the pump and signal beams along suitable long distances and secondly protecting the hybrid perovskite layer from moisture/air degradation.

The device presents a net gain of around 10 dB cm<sup>-1</sup> and 3-4 nm linewidth with an energy threshold as low as 2 nJ pulse<sup>-1</sup>. A decreased threshold compared to previous results which was remarkably obtained without requiring short pulsed lasers, a clear indicator of the powerful waveguide approach proposed in the present work.
