### Article: [Thermal degradation of CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> perovskite into NH<sub>3</sub> and CH<sub>3</sub>I gases observed by coupled thermogravimetry mass spectrometry analysis](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2016/EE/C6EE02016J#!divAbstract)


Thermal gravimetric and differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) coupled with quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation and first principles calculations were employed to elucidate the chemical nature of released gases during the thermal decomposition of MAPbI<sub>3</sub>. Contrarily to the common wisdom that CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>3</sub>PbI<sub>3</sub> is decomposed into CH<sub>3</sub>NH<sub>2</sub> and HI, the major gases were methyliodide (CH<sub>3</sub>I) and ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>). We anticipate our finding will provide new insights for further formulations of the perovskite active material and device design that can prevent the methylammonium decomposition and thus increase the long-term stability of perovsktie-based optoelectronic devices.
