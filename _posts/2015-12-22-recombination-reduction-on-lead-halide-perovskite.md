### [Recombination reduction on lead halide perovskite solar cells based on low temperature synthesized hierarchical TiO<small><sub>2</sub></small> nanorods](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2015/NR/C5NR06692A#!divAbstract)

Intensive research on the electron transport material (ETM) has been pursued to improve the efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and decrease their cost. More importantly, the role of the ETM layer is not yet fully understood, and research on new device architectures is still needed. Here, we report the use of three-dimensional (3D) TiO<sub>2</sub> with a hierarchical architecture based on rutile nanorods (NR) as photoanode material for PSCs.
