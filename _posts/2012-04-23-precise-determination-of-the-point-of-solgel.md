### [Precise determination of the point of sol-gel transition in carbon gel synthesis using a microwave heating method](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.carbon.2010.05.013)

A simple and precise method for determining the point of gelation in microwave-assisted synthesis of organic gels is reported. This method provide a relevant information in the carbon gels field, as it can be applied to stop the gelation process at the precise instant for using the material in further processes where it is necessary to have the material with a specific viscosity (i.e., point of gelation).
