|*Capacitance vs. V curves for carbon xerogel-based supercapacitors*| 




### [Carbon Xerogel and Manganese Oxide Capacitive Materials for Advanced Supercapacitors](http://www.electrochemsci.org/papers/vol6/6030596.pdf)

Symmetric supercapacitors (SSC) and asymmetric supercapacitors (ASC) that use carbon xerogels with different porous textures as negative electrode and manganese oxide as positive electrode were investigated. Figure shows the capacitance curves versus potential for these carbon xerogel-based supercapacitors. Voltage sweep rate:10 mVs<sup>âˆ’1</sup>.
